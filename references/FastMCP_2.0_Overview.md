# Welcome to FastMCP 2.0!

> The fast, Pythonic way to build MCP servers and clients.

**FastMCP is the standard framework for building MCP applications.** The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) provides a standardized way to connect LLMs to tools and data, and FastMCP makes it production-ready with clean, Pythonic code:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Demo üöÄ")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

## Beyond Basic MCP

FastMCP pioneered Python MCP development, with FastMCP 1.0 being incorporated into the [official MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) in 2024.

**This is FastMCP 2.0** ‚Äî the actively maintained version that extends far beyond basic protocol implementation. While the SDK provides core functionality, FastMCP 2.0 delivers everything needed for production: advanced MCP patterns (server composition, proxying, OpenAPI/FastAPI generation, tool transformation), enterprise auth (Google, GitHub, Azure, Auth0, WorkOS, and more), deployment tools, testing frameworks, and comprehensive client libraries.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. It is often described as "the USB-C port for AI", providing a uniform way to connect LLMs to resources they can use. It may be easier to think of it as an API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

* Expose data through `Resources` (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
* Provide functionality through `Tools` (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
* Define interaction patterns through `Prompts` (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
* And more!

FastMCP provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for building, managing, and interacting with these servers.

## Why FastMCP?

FastMCP handles all the complex protocol details so you can focus on building. In most cases, decorating a Python function is all you need ‚Äî FastMCP handles the rest.

- üöÄ **Fast**: High-level interface means less code and faster development
- üçÄ **Simple**: Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate
- üêç **Pythonic**: Feels natural to Python developers
- üîç **Complete**: Everything for production ‚Äî enterprise auth (Google, GitHub, Azure, Auth0, WorkOS), deployment tools, testing frameworks, client libraries, and more

FastMCP provides the shortest path from idea to production. Deploy locally, to the cloud with [FastMCP Cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud) (free for personal servers), or to your own infrastructure.

FastMCP is made with üíô by [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/).

## LLM-Friendly Docs

The FastMCP documentation is available in multiple LLM-friendly formats:

### MCP Server

The FastMCP docs are accessible via MCP! The server URL is `https://gofastmcp.com/mcp`.

You can use FastMCP to search the FastMCP docs:

```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

async def main():
    async with Client("https://gofastmcp.com/mcp") as client:
        result = await client.call_tool(
            name="SearchFastMcp", 
            arguments={"query": "deploy a FastMCP server"}
        )
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Plain Text Formats

The docs are also available in [llms.txt format](https://llmstxt.org/):

* [llms.txt](https://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt) - A sitemap listing all documentation pages
* [llms-full.txt](https://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt) - The entire documentation in one file (may exceed context windows)

Any page can be accessed as markdown by appending `.md` to the URL. For example, this page becomes `https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome.md`.

You can also copy any page as markdown by pressing "Cmd+C" (or "Ctrl+C" on Windows) on your keyboard.
